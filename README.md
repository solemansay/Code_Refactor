# code-refactor
This is my first homework assignment while attending the coding Bootcamp at UNC Charlotte. I enjoyed this little project and I feel much more confident reading and writing code. Having to correct the code was equal parts enjoyable and frustrating. My instructor said that it can be like playing wack-a-mole and I didn't quite understand until I experimented, refreshing and saving to watch certain aspects of the website change as I messed with the &#60;div&#62;'s. I'm excited about my next challenge and to learn everything that I can about coding! 

# About the assignment:
What I noticed as soon as I opened the HTML file was the sheer amount of &#60;div&#62;'s and that some content was not filled out, such as the title which I added the name of the website. 
When I opened the HTML file in my browser I noticed that one of the links didn't work so I fixed that with a missing id.
Another attribute missing from the HTML file was the ALT for each image which I added.
There were also some out of order &#60;h&#62; tags that I put into sequential order. 
Once I finished that I began replacing &#60;div&#62;'s for proper semantic elements and in turn replaced those for the classes and id's in the CSS file. 
I also eliminated some un-needed code on the CSS file by taking multiple groups of identical code with different classes or id's and replacing them with a semantic element that encompassed them all.
