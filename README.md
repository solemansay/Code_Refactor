# code-refactor
This is my first homework assignment while attending the coding bootcamp at UNC Charlotte. I really enjoyed this little project and I feel much more confident reading and writing code. having to correct the code was equal parts enjoyable and frustrating. My instructor said that it can be like playing wack-a-mole and I didnt quite understand until I actually experimented and kept refreshing and saving to watch certain aspects of the website change as I messed with the &#60;div&#62;'s. I'm excited for my next challenge and to learn everything that I can about coding! 

About the assignment 
What I noticed as soon as I opened the html file was the sheer amount of &#60;div&#62;'s and that some content was not totally filled out, such as the title in the head. Once I fixed the titles I opened the CSS file and realized that there was far more code than nessicarry, I exchanged some of the &#60;div&#62;'s for proper sematics elements and in turn replaced those for the classes and id's in the css file. I also eliminated some un-needed code on the css file by taking multiple groups of identicle code with different classes and replacing them with a semantic element that encompassed them all.
